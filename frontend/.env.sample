# Vite requires env variables that are exposed to the client to be prefixed with VITE_

# HTTP backend base URL (used by fetch/axios calls)
VITE_BACKEND_HTTP=http://localhost:4000

# WebSocket backend URL (ws:// or wss://). If empty, frontend will build it from VITE_BACKEND_HTTP
VITE_BACKEND_WS=ws://localhost:4000

# Optionally override the public URL for assets
# VITE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=



# Important: Vite inlines import.meta.env at build time. When you run npm run build / deploy, your host must provide these env vars to the build step (Vercel/Netlify have an “Environment Variables” section where you add them).
# If you leave VITE_BACKEND_WS empty, the code in App.jsx will derive ws from VITE_BACKEND_HTTP automatically (it replaces http with ws), but for HTTPS you should explicitly use wss://.

# VITE_BACKEND_WS=wss://arduino-chess.onrender.com
